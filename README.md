## Overview
The purpose of this project (using Tableau) is to analyze the global sales dataset to uncover key business insights, understand customer purchasing behavior, time periods(seasonality), monitor revenue income, profitability, and provide insights and recommendations that can help improve sales performance, inventory planning, and customer service efficiency.
## Objectives
- Which countries or region contribute the highest sales?
- Profit margin comparison per country, region, market and category.
- Identify the sales and profit over the trend of time(years, quarters, months, etc.).
- Which segment and order priority is responsible for the most sales and profit.
- Determine which ship mode drives the most sales.

## Dataset Description
- Order details (Order ID, Order Priority, Ship Mode).
- Customer information (Customer ID, Segment, Region, Country, City).
- Product hierarchy (Category, Sub-Category, Product Name).
- Financials (Sales, Profit, Discount, Quantity).
- Date details (Order Date).

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Created calculated fields, sets, parameters and bins for data visualization and analysis.
- Created worksheet visualizations using different dimensions and measures.

## Insights
- Total Sales are concentrated in a few high-performing regions (typically the Central, North, and South).
- Sales consistently peak in November and December (holiday season), with a noticeable dip in February and March.
- There’s a steady upward trend in overall annual sales, indicating business growth potential.
- Technology accounts for the largest portion of sales and though Office Supplies has the lowest sales, it yields more profit than Furniture category. 
- The Consumer segment drives the highest sales and profit, followed by the Corporate segment.
- Standard Class shipping is the most frequently used and yields the highest sales and profit.
- Phones, Copiers, Chairs, Bookcases and Storage items are among the most sold products.
- Tables frequently show negative profit, likely due to high shipping costs and discounts.
- Labels and Fasteners deliver smaller revenue but high profitability.

## Recommendations
- Focus marketing efforts and inventory buildup before holiday period(November, December) to maximize peak-season revenue.
- Expand successful Technology product lines in regions with growing demand.
- Reduce discount levels for low-margin categories like Furniture.
- Focus on promoting high-margin items (e.g., accessories, papers, label and copiers, etc.)
- Launch a loyalty program targeting high-value customers.
- Send personalized product recommendations to drive repeat sales and to boost low revenue products sales.
- Apply higher discounts only to products with excess stock or slow movement.
- Launch new products or campaigns during mid-year months (May–August) to balance seasonal dips.
- Discontinue or renegotiate suppliers for chronically unprofitable products.
